# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This project is a solution to the [QR Code Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to recreate a responsive QR card component using only HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although simple in scope, the challenge provided a great opportunity to revisit core frontend principles. My solution emphasizes clean structure, semantic HTML, and responsive design—all built with a mobile-first approach.

Key highlights of the build:

- Centered layout using CSS Grid for vertical + horizontal centering
- Custom properties for consistent and scalable color theming
- Responsive design with media queries
- Typography powered by Google Fonts (`Outfit`)
- Accessible image with descriptive `alt` text
- Minimal, inline CSS for ease of testing and portability

This project reinforces how even basic components benefit from careful attention to spacing, hierarchy, and readability. It's a great reminder that polish and consistency matter at every level of the frontend stack.

### Continued development

For future mini projects like this, I’d like to:

- Use these as opportunities to test out more advanced layout systems
- Explore CSS animations or transitions for subtle visual enhancements
- Refine accessibility and responsive behavior more intentionally
